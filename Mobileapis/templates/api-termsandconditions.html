<h4>COMPLAINTS and LIABILITY</h4>

<p>The receiver should check the goods upon delivery. The receiver must check the shipment to verify that (transportation) damage has not occurred and/or there are no missing items.</p>

<p>The Recipient, or the Customer is required to raise a complaint in connection with (transport) damage or missing items delivered and to sign the delivery note stating damage or items missing. Failure to record the problem at delivery or notify AIRDELY as soon as the delivery has happened within 48 hours will result in the customer losing all his rights in claiming for damages or shortages unless there is intent or a shortcoming by AIRDELY. Recipient to notify the complaint in writing to AIRDELY must include the nature of the damage or loss. Photographic evidence of the damage items and the packing (external and internal) will be required to support the complaint and additional supporting paperwork (cost receipts) as needed.</p>

<p>A consignment is regarded as missing if not delivered within thirty days after collection. Legitimate complaints after this period are assessed on an individual basis and AIRDELY has no obligation to oblige.</p> 

<p>Complaints from customers, even if submitted in time, do not automatically suspend payment of the carriage costs. Customer must pay the full cost of the service rendered before any claims will be processed.</p>

<p>AIRDELY accepts no liability for any damage or any kind regardless of how caused, including any inaccuracy, incompleteness of information, or incorrect or improper selection or implementation of services of the hired carriers and / or experts, breach of contract, tort or otherwise, unless the damage is due to intentional or a shortcoming of AIRDELY. Furthermore AIRDELY accepts no liability for indirect damages, which include consequential damages, lost profits, lost savings and business opportunities.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the other provisions, and subject to any other written agreements, AIRDELY, including its employees and associated consultants have a limit of liability not greater than 25% of the invoice value of the relevant underlying transaction or up to a maximum of SGD400.00 which ever is lower where a serious failing of AIRDELY is determined.</p>

<p>In all the above cases, the damages are based on the actual value of the consignment at the place and time of receipt. The starting point is the number of missing or damaged kilograms. Furthermore, in any case of partial loss any settlement will be proportionally refunded up to the maximum limit of SGD400.00. The actual value will be determined on the basis of customs, repair, replacement, purchase or market value, which is the lowest value.</p>

<p>AIRDELY shall not be liable if the loss, damage or delay is caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. debt or an order of the Customer or recipient.</li>

<li>b. a defect in the order.</li>

<li>c. conditions that the Air traveller and /or Carrier could not avoid and whose consequences it could not have prevented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Air travellers shall take all reasonable precaution to prevent unauthorised persons from having access to the shipment and shall also take all reasonable precaution against loss of or damage to the shipment.</p>

<p>Air travellers shall make reasonable effort to deliver the shipment according to the respective delivery schedules, which are estimates only and not guaranteed. Air travellers shall however not be liable (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any delays in affecting delivery of the shipment for whatever reasons.</p>

<p>Air travellers shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from or in connection with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a.  The Customer’s failure to specify any precautions to be taken in respect of a shipment.</li>

<li>b.  Air travellers’ failure to perform any of his/ her obligations hereunder as a consequence of circumstances outside his/her control.</li>

<li>c.  Any acts or omissions of any party other than the Air traveller himself/herself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer agrees that AIRDELY’s liability in respect of the shipment is strictly limited to direct loss only. All other types of loss or damage are excluded (including but not limited to loss of profits, income, interest, future business, or loss of revenue resulting from loss of use), whether such loss or damage is special or indirect, and even if the risk of such loss or damage was brought to AIRDELY’s attention before or after acceptance of the delivery request. The Customer shall insure at its own costs against any risks in respect of the shipment.</p>

<p>AIRDELY’s total liability in respect of any shipment shall be limited to its actual cash value but in any event shall not exceed SGD$400.00 (whichever is the lower). One shipment is defined as a delivery order with one unique order code and may include one or more stops. If customer considers these limits as insufficient to protect itself or the shipment, then it must make its own insurance arrangements, failing which customer shall assume all risks of loss or damage in respect of the shipment. AIRDELY shall not be under any liability to offer customers’ cargo insurance or to buy any insurance in respect of the shipment. </p>

<p>AIRDELY shall not be liable for loss or damage arising from or in connection with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a.  The Customer’s failure to specify any special precautions to be taken in respect of a Shipment.</li>

<li>b.  Delivery of fragile items including but not limited to items such as cupcakes, flowers, glassware and musical instruments.</li>

<li>c.  The misalignment, wear and tear, de-arrangement, heat, mold, rot, discoloration, degeneration, explosion, ignition or the hazardous, perishable, corruptible, fragile, or brittle nature of the contents of the shipment.</li>

<li>d.  Delay or confiscation by any government authority due to the discovery of prohibited contents of the shipment.</li>

<li>e.  AIRDELY failure to perform any of its obligations hereunder as a consequence of circumstances outside its control, including without limitation any act of God such as weather conditions, flood or earthquake, work stoppages, strikes, industrial disputes, war, any act of government, accidents, traffic obstructions or congestion, mechanical breakdown, or other events of force majeure.</li>

<li>f.  Any acts or omissions of any party other than AIRDELY, including and without limitation the Customer, the named addressee, any government official or any subcontractor engaged by customer.</li>

<li>g.  Damages to items of brittle nature or damages to items due to inappropriate packaging.</li>
</ul>

<p>AIRDELY will make every reasonable effort to execute the delivery request according to AIRDELY’s delivery schedules prevailing from time to time, but these schedules are not binding and do not form part of the contract. AIRDELY is not liable for any damages or loss caused by delays.</p>

<p>AIRDELY shall not be liable for delay or non-delivery of a shipment arising from or in connection with the detention of the shipment by any government authority.</p>

<p>AIRDELY shall not be liable for indirect or consequential loss or damage, including without limitation loss of profit, income, interest, future business or anticipated savings, even if the risk of such loss or damage was brought to AIRDELY’s attention before or after acceptance of the shipment.</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, AIRDELY shall not in any way be liable or responsible for a delivery item prior to the shipment being accepted by AIRDELY for delivery.</p>

<p>The Customer must still continue to pay our invoices in full as they become due, even though you may have submitted a claim to us.</p>

<ul>
<li>a.

AIRDELY will especially exercise extreme care to prevent unauthorized access to unauthorized information from the Customer. The Customer is deemed to use the standard safety equipment that reasonably they ought to have on a computer, such as anti-virus, anti-spam, anti-spyware, Anti-mail true, anti-phishing and firewall solution.

<h4>CONDITIONS of COURIER</h4> 

<p>The shipments shall be carried at the sole risk of the Customer. The Customer hereby exempts AIRDELY from and indemnifies the Company against all liability of whatsoever nature, arising directly or indirectly from handling of the goods. This exemption and indemnity includes, but is not restricted to any liability for direct and/or consequential loss or damages arising from the loss of the goods, damage to the goods, the failure to collect or deliver the goods timeously, adequately or at all or from or to the correct address and/or from any other cause arising, whether any such liability, loss or damage is caused by or arises from breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence, on the part of AIRDELY, its servants, agents, employees or otherwise.</p>

<p>The Customer is required to ensure that it has communicated any special conditions, instructions or requirements for the courier of the goods, including delivery and/or storage instructions, time sensitive documents etc clearly and legibly in writing on the waybill accompanying the goods. No other instruction, whether verbal or written, shall be accepted as binding on AIRDELY.</p>

<p>Any limited liability of AIRDELY shall terminate on the delivery of the goods to the Consignee at the address as set out by the Customer on the waybill.</p>

<h4>INSURANCE</h4>

<p>AIRDELY shall, only if requested to do so in writing by the Customer, effect insurance on any goods carried by it for and on behalf of the Customer in terms hereof, at the Customer’s expense. Any such insurances effected by the Company shall be subject to the usual exceptions and conditions of insurance held by the Company as indicated by the insurer or underwriter accepting the risk, and shall be subject to the necessary and required insurance declarations as to the nature and value of the goods in respect of each consignment requiring insurance to be prepared by the Customer.</p>

<p>Theft, accidents, human failure and delay - these are just a few of the risks and perils that are exposed to your shipment. The Customer can insure their shipments. AIRDELY offers appropriate, one-off cargo insurances. AIRDELY is able to arrange insurance covering the value in respect of loss of or damage to the Shipment, provided that the Shipper so instructs AIRDELY in writing. Shipment insurance does not cover indirect loss or damage, or loss or damage caused by delays.</p>

<p>AIRDELY provides insurance up to SGD400 per shipment. Any shipment that requires insurance over SGD400 will be subjected to an additional fee. This additional fee shall be 6% of the Insured Declared Value (IDV). For example purposes only, if the IDV of an item is $1000 and a Customer requests to purchase insurance for the entire value of the item, the fee shall be 6% multiplied by the IDV. Insurance only covers damage or loss while shipment is in AIRDELY’s possession. AIRDELY can not be held responsible if an airline loses an Item or Shipment, or if Customs takes possession or destroys the shipment. AIRDELY will not be responsible if there is consequential damage that results from the delay, damage or loss of a Shipment. If a Customer has a valid claim, they will receive reimbursement within three to ten (3 ~10) business days. Proof of purchase price is required to receive the full claim.</p>

<p>Since the transportation of the Customer shipments is mostly in the hands of third parties (Air travellers, delivery agent, forwarders, carriers), AIRDELY cannot exercise influence on the safety on your shipments.</p> 

<p>AIRDELY shall not be required to effect a separate insurance on each consignment.</p>

<p>Should insurer dispute any liability for any reason, Customer shall have recourse against the insurer only, and AIRDELY shall not be under any liability in relation thereto.</p>
